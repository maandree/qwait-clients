We need to take care of error messages from the server.

Needs testing:
      libqwaitclient_qwait_get_admins
      libqwaitclient_qwait_get_users
      libqwaitclient_qwait_find_user
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_hidden
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_locked
      libqwaitclient_qwait_clear_queue
      libqwaitclient_qwait_delete_queue
      libqwaitclient_qwait_create_queue
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_wait
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_wait_comment
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_wait_location
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_moderator
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_queue_owner
      libqwaitclient_qwait_set_admin
      libqwaitclient_qwait_get_login_information

We need to be able get push notifications from the server,
preferably using WebSocket.

Is it possible to utilise the user's Kerberos-tokens
to avoid asking for username (okay, we could as the
OS for the username) and password?
